# MechanicsAndRobotics
Summary of the courses of mechanics and robotics that I had during the academic year 2018/2019

## Industrial Robotics
During this course we learned about rotation matrices and how so solve kinematics (inverse and direct) and inverse dynamics using the Lagrange approach of robotic arms.
The couse was taught by professor Bortoluzzi at the University of Trento.

## Modeling and Simulation of Mechatronical Systems
This course was a sumary of all the classical dynamics applied to multiple bodies.
The couse was taught by professor Biral at the University of Trento.
The main content of the courses where:
* Rotation matrices and reference systems
* Constraint equations of mechanical systems
* Global and recursive approach for the modeling of mechanical systems
* Kinematic analysis of mechanisms: position and velocity analysis
* Principle of virtual work
* The Newton-Euler approach for finding the equation of motion of a system of bodies
* The Lagrange approach for finding the equation of motion of a system of bodies
* How to solve inverse and direct dynamics
* Linearization of systems
* Friction models: Coulomb and Dhal

In addition professor Bertolazzi did an in depth teaching about Differential Algebric Equations (DAE):
* How to split the algebric and differential part in DAE
* How to find the index of a DAE and its invariants
* How to compute the initial conditions of a DAE
* Numerical methods to solve a DAE: Runge-Kutta methods
* How to stabilize the numerical solution of a DAE: the Baumgarte stabilization and the projection method
